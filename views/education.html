<h1>Education</h1>

<p>
Bitcoin is a deep topic. While there's lots of information to be found online, nothing beats meeting someone in person who can answer your questions and explain things clearly and concisely.  We can help with that!
We regularly host group information sessions and presentations.  Stay tuned to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bitcoincoop">our Facebook page</a> to learn when the next one will be scheduled.
