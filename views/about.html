  <h1>About Us</h1>

<p>The Bitcoin Co-op <!-- a registered co-operative association in the province of British Columbia.  We are --> is a voluntary association of individuals united by a shared interest in Bitcoin, a revolutionary digital currency and payment technology. Through our website, social media and other forms of publicity, we promote Bitcoin and the businesses who believe in it. We also organize events such as presentations, discussions, pub nights, parties, and other creative outings to educate the public and grow the economy.
</p>

<p>
If you want some bitcoins of your own or feel like trading some in for cash, we facilitate in-person, peer-to-peer exchange of bitcoins to and from Canadian dollars. If you've never bought any before, our trustworthy exchangers can walk you through the process. We'll get you your coins discretely and at a fair price.
</p>

<p>
We know Bitcoin can sometimes be difficult to understand, which is why we provide consultation and technical assistance. Members and businesses who join our network enjoy the support of experienced professionals in software and finance, as well as PR and media resources when they are in need.
