  <p>We're a voluntary and inclusive association of individuals united by a shared interest in <a href="http://bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a>, a revolutionary new digital currency and payment technology. We organize presentations, discussions, pub nights, parties, and other creative outings to foster a community of people and businesses interested in learning about and creating a new economy.

<p>
We help businesses accept Bitcoin payments in their brick and mortar locations and online.  We provide one-on-one tutoring and consultation to help people learn how Bitcoin works.
Our members enjoy the support of experienced professionals in software and finance, as well as PR and media resources.
