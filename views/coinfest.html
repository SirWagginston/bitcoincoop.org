<h1>CoinFest 2015, Vancouver</h1>

<p>CoinFest is a decentralized, open source, 3-day celebration of cryptocurrency. The first CoinFest was held in Vancouver in 2013; it later spread to cities across Canada as a simultaneous convention. Now CoinFest is a holiday celebrated around the world, with 25 cities gearing up to incentivize adoption and educate the public.</p>

<p>CoinFest in Vancouver will last all 3 days, and continue to uphold the traditions of free attendance and the no-fiat rule. February 22 will once again be the conference, and February 21 will be a decentralized variety of events. Plans for February 20 are still ongoing.</p>

  <p>While CoinFest is intended to be fun and accessible to people of all means, we don't want to alienate those looking for a serious networking event. Thankfully, a <strong>high-class Italian restaurant</strong> in downtown Vancouver accepts Bitcoin; those looking for a more exclusive event can come to <a href="http://www.francescos.com/" title="Francesco's" target="_blank">Francesco's</a>, where the Bitcoin elite will dine on some of the finest dishes available for BTC.</p>
  <p>Guests will have half an hour to mingle before dinner will be served at 6:00. <a href="http://www.vanbex.com/" title="Vanbex Group" target="_blank">Vanbex Group</a> will be sponsoring the event, which will feature a special Bitcoin menu. They provide consultation and marketing services to major players in decentralization like Storj, Counterparty, Tether and Factom. A portion of funds will be used to treat contest winners, so young entrepreneurs get the chance to <strong></strong>network with important decision-makers.</strong></p>
